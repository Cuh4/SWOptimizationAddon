# üå† | Optimization Addon

## üìö | Overview
An addon that optimizes Stormworks multiplayer by despawning objects every tick, therefore reducing the amount of things that need to be synchronized between clients in a server.

This addon uses [Aurora Framework](https://github.com/Cuh4/AuroraFramework), a framework I created that tremendously helps with addon development.

This addon was created for this [cool dude.](https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561199259162532)

Feel free to `git clone`, or even contribute.

## ‚ùì | Requirements
- **Python 3.12.1+**
- **Stormworks: Build and Rescue** (game)

## üíª | Setup
### üòé | Simple
1) [Subscribe to the addon from the Steam workshop.](TODO) TODO
2) Create a new save, but before loading it, enable this addon.
3) When enabling the addon, you will see a cog icon. Click it to open up the options menu, then configure the addon to however you desire. The default options are recommended.
4) Load into the save and go wild.

### ü§ì | Advanced
1) Run `git clone "https://github.com/Cuh4/SWOptimizationAddon.git"`
2) Optionally, change the addon name in `playlist.xml` to whatever you desire.
3) Run `py combiner.py` to merge all of the code into a `script.lua` file. Feel free to stop it with `CTRL + C` once it has been created.
4) Run `sync.bat`. This will effectively clone the addon into `%appdata%/Stormworks/data/missions`, allowing you to use this addon in-game regardless of what directory the addon is in.
5) Create a save with the addon enabled, and have fun with the addon.
